## What is Cybersecurity?
- Protection of systems, networks, apps, and data
- Focus areas:
  - Prevention
  - Detection
  - Response
  - Recovery
- Assumption: **systems will be attacked**

---

## CIA Triad

### Confidentiality
- Prevents unauthorized access to data
- Controls:
  - Encryption
  - Access control
  - Network segmentation
- Attacker focus:
  - Credential theft
  - Misconfigured permissions
  - Data leaks

---

### Integrity
- Ensures data is not altered improperly
- Controls:
  - Hashing
  - Digital signatures
  - File integrity monitoring
- Attacker focus:
  - Data tampering
  - MITM attacks
  - Config manipulation

---

### Availability
- Ensures systems remain accessible
- Controls:
  - Redundancy
  - Backups
  - DDoS protection
- Attacker focus:
  - DoS attacks
  - Ransomware
  - Resource exhaustion

---

## Defense in Depth
- Use **multiple security layers**
- No single control is trusted
- Common layers:
  - Physical
  - Network
  - Host
  - Application
  - Identity
  - Monitoring
- Goal:
  - Slow attackers
  - Increase detection
  - Reduce blast radius

---

## Least Privilege
- Users/systems get **minimum required access**
- Examples:
  - No default admin access
  - Role-based permissions
  - Time-limited access
- Common failure:
  - Over-permissioned accounts → privilege escalation

---

## Zero Trust (High-Level)
- Trust nothing by default
- Verify:
  - Identity
  - Device
  - Context
- Core ideas:
  - Verify explicitly
  - Use least privilege
  - Assume breach
- Common use:
  - Cloud
  - Remote access
  - Hybrid networks

---

## Security Controls

### Preventive
- Stop attacks before they happen
- Examples:
  - Firewalls
  - MFA
  - Access control lists

---

### Detective
- Identify attacks or violations
- Examples:
  - Logs
  - IDS/IPS
  - Security monitoring

---

### Corrective
- Reduce impact after incident
- Examples:
  - Backups
  - Incident response
  - System recovery

---

## Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk

### Threat
- Anything capable of causing harm
- Examples:
  - Malware
  - Hackers
  - Insider abuse

---

### Vulnerability
- Weakness that can be exploited
- Examples:
  - Weak passwords
  - Unpatched software
  - Misconfigurations

---

### Risk
- Impact of threat exploiting vulnerability
- Model:
